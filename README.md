# Fundamental-of-programming-language
Welcome to my APT 1030 Assignments Repository!

This repository contains a collection of programming assignments I completed during my APT 1030 class. Each assignment was designed to enhance my understanding of programming concepts and improve my coding skills. Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository.

Assignment 1: Area Calculation Program
The first program I created calculates the area of various shapes. This assignment helped me grasp the fundamental principles of geometry and allowed me to translate mathematical formulas into code. Users can input the type of shape (such as a rectangle, circle, or triangle) and the necessary dimensions, and the program will calculate the area accordingly. 

Key Concepts:
Input and Output handling
Conditional statements (if, else)
Functions for reusable code
Assignment 2: Grade Calculation Program
In the second assignment, I developed a program that calculates and displays a student's grades based on their scores. This program allows input of multiple assessments, takes into account weighting for different assignments, and calculates the final grade accordingly. It was an excellent exercise in data management and arithmetic operations.

Key Concepts:
Data structures (arrays/lists)
Looping constructs
Arithmetic operations and logic
Assignment 3: Login Interface Program
The final assignment involved creating a simple login interface. The program prompts the user to input a password, checks its length, and verifies whether it matches a predefined password. If the user enters the correct password (while ensuring it is 8 characters or less), the program displays "Login Successful." If the input is incorrect or exceeds 8 characters, it displays "Login Not Successful." This project was crucial in understanding user authentication basics and input validation.

Key Concepts:
String manipulation
Logical conditions
User input validation
Conclusion
These assignments provided a solid foundation in programming principles and practical applications. They served not only as a way to practice coding but also as a stepping stone towards more complex programming challenges. I hope you find the contents of this repository informative and helpful in understanding my learning journey in the APT 1030 class. Feel free to explore the codes.

Thank you for visiting!
